# Runtime Identifier Dependencies

The NuGet package for the C# bindings includes binary distributions for major platform runtimes targeted by [liblsl](https://github.com/sccn/liblsl). To successfully build the package, these binaries need to be downloaded from [liblsl releases](https://github.com/sccn/liblsl/releases) and included in this folder following the RID naming conventions outlined in the [RID Catalog](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/rid-catalog).
